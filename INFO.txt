"ExecuteMerge" will load all .rexs stored in folder path wich is the first
parameter string path...
Then will merge all files in a new directory, that it is the secound parameter.. (this is the job).

"ConfigDialog" will make easy to spesify language etc..
it will dialog in the console and request flags to select
languages and folders etc..  it will create folders where the merged file will be set and
all files of this lang.. will be moved in as well.


can be -> var folders = ConfigDialog(workingFolder);
it will ask for which language will work with...

var folders = ConfigDialog(workingFolder, "ru, fr, de");
will not ask for the lang so it will generate it as its spesified...


ExecuteTheMerge(f, f); works as it but in order to marge in differents folders
so can be looped


It will as well generate a file in the folder of the language (info.txt)
with all nodes that the value repeat for different keys.



//-----------------------


ðŸš© need to respect S"O"LID principals

i will add interface in order to respect "Open close" principal


ðŸš© as well i add method to take another list that will gives The
id that was deleted because repeats



ðŸš© solo da valor que repite Name solo si el valor es diferente para el mismo Name
y si no fue annadido al merge
es decir va a dar una lista con los valores que estan equivocados por repetir el
mismo id solo si los valores son diferentes para ese mismo id y si no ha sido
annadido al merge
